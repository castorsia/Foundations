    "# Homework 10: Cleaning data with Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Time to use regular expressions!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hints and notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening files in subdirectories\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this notebook might be **homework/**, but!!! the csvs and text files might be in **homework/scraped/** or **/homework/scraped/minutes_pdfs** or **/homework/pdfs/**. To open a file in a subdirectory, instead of having the filename be `\"file.csv\"` you'll just use `\"some/subfolder/file.csv\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening text files\n",
    "\n",
    "This will open up a file, read it in and show you the first 500 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "contents = open(\"your-filename.txt\").read()\n",
    "contents[0:500]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> You might need `open(\"your-filename.txt\", encoding=\"utf8\").read()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using regex\n",
    "\n",
    "For some dumb reason you need to put `r` in front of the string you use when you're talking about regex. Just plain `\"(\\d\\d\\d)\"` will usually work, but *sometimes* it won't and you'll need `r\"(\\d\\d\\d)`. It's best to just use the `r` all of the time, if you can remember!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `.str.extract`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use `.str.extract`, you're always going to **capture one thing** and save it to a new column. You need to wrap the things you're interested in with parenthesis `(` `)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df['phone_number'] = df['old_column'].str.extract(r\"My phone number is (\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting pandas options\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has a lot of options, like how many columns or rows it will show you, or how many characters it will show in a column before it stops showing you anything. Here are a few useful ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `display.max_cols`: Number of columns to show at once\n",
    "* `display.max_rows`: Number of rows to show at once\n",
    "* `display.max_colwidth`: Maximum number of characters displayed from a string\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set them using `pd.set_option(\"display.max_rows\", 1000)`, for example, to show 1000 rows at a time. You can find a lot more at https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.set_option.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular expressions reference\n",
    "\n",
    "I personally think http://www.regular-expressions.info/ is a wonderful wonderful reference (and tutorial), even if it's ugly! But here's a quick reference for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\d` is a digit\n",
    "* `\\d*` is zero or more digits \n",
    "* `\\d+` is one or more digits\n",
    "* `.` matches anything for ONE character\n",
    "* `.*` is \"give me anything forever\"\n",
    "* `\\s` is whitespace, a.k.a. spaces and tabs\n",
    "* `\\w` is a word character, which includes capital and lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens.\n",
    "* You can put `*` after anything, so `\\w*` would mean \"as many word characters as you can find\"\n",
    "* `\\b` is a word boundary (you'll need the `r\"\"` thing for this one)\n",
    "* `( )` is a \"capture group\" for saving something\n",
    "* `\\1` is used when doing find/replace to say \"put the first captured group here\" (note, it's a dollar sign instead of a backslash in some editors)\n",
    "* `[ABCDE]` is a character class, which means \"match one of these, I don't care which\"\n",
    "* dollar sign means \"end of the line\"\n",
    "* caret ^ means \"beginning of the line\"\n",
    "* `\\.` means \"no really seriously I mean a period not just anything\"\n",
    "* You can use `\\` with anything else that would normally be a special character, too, not just periods. `(` or `[` or whatever.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning up extracted columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you get `\\n` (newlines) or spaces or `\\t` (tabs) or stuff at the beginning or the end of your column. `.str.strip()` will usually take care of that, just attach it after your `.str.extract()`\n",
    "\n",
    "After you extract something, it's still a string even though you look at it and know it's a number. Use `.astype(int)` to turn it into an integer (no decimal) or `.astype(float)` to turn it into a float (yes decimal)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing regular expressions in general\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if I'm using regex in pandas or Python, I like to test them in my text editor with \"Find.\" The highlighting really helps me see if I'm matching things! I also like to think \"what stays the same?\" when designing patterns, write those parts first, then fill in the blanks with what I want to capture."

    "# Part 1: Using `.str.extract` to pull data from columns in pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 H&M\n",
    "\n",
    "Open up `hm.csv` from the `scraped` directory. I want **four new columns**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `price_original`, the original price, one of the new price\n",
    "2. `price_discounted`, the discounted price\n",
    "3. `pct_discount`, the percent discount\n",

    "\n",
    "**Tip:** Remember that `$` is a special regex symbol! You might need to escape it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** When doing `.str.extract`, the whole match doesn't get captured, only what you put `()` around! Think about anchoring to different points of the string, or things in the string.\n",

    "**Tip:** Not all prices have cents!\n",

Eligibility \\n\\nfor access to classified information is denied.  \\n\\nStatement of the Case \\n\\nOn  June  16,  2015,  the  Department  of  Defense  Consolidated  Adjudications \\nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \\nconcerns  under  Guideline  G,  alcohol  consumption.  DOD  CAF  acted  under  Executive \\nOrder  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information  within  Industry  (February  20, \\n1960),  as  amended;  DOD  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security \\nClearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the \\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  answered  the  SOR  on  July  14,  2015,  and  elected  to  have  his  case \\ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \\nGovernment’s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 9, 2015. The evidence \\n\\n) \\n) \\n) \\n) \\n) \\n) \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n \\n \\n\\n\\x0cincluded in the FORM is identified as Items 4-10 and is admitted into the record (Items \\n1-3 are pleadings and transmittal documents). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who \\nreceived it on October 19, 2015. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections \\nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted an undated \\nresponse to the FORM, which was admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibit (AE) \\nA. The case was assigned to me on December 21, 2015.  \\n\\nIn Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all but one of the allegations. The \\nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and \\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.1 \\n\\n \\nApplicant is 56 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since 1997. He \\nis divorced and has three children, ages 15, 18, and 20. He has a bachelor’s degree. He \\nhas no military experience.2  \\n \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s conduct raised in the SOR included: a history of consuming alcohol, \\nat times, to excess from 1974 to about April 2014; being found guilty for operating under \\nthe  influence  of  alcohol  (OUI)  in  February  1991;  being  found  guilty  for  OUI  2nd  in \\nNovember 1997; and being found guilty for OUI 3rd in November 2010 (See SOR ¶¶ 1.a \\n- 1.d).3 \\n \\n \\nApplicant  began  drinking  alcohol  when  he  was  approximately  15  years  old  in \\n1974. He drinks beer on most occasions. Even after his OUI convictions, he stated he \\nwas  still  was  consuming  two  to  three  beers  a  week.  He  drinks  in  social  settings  and \\nafter hockey games. As a result of his 2010 OUI conviction, he lost his driver’s license \\nfor five years. He completed his probation in May 2015.4 \\n \\n \\nCourt documents establish that Applicant was found guilty of three OUI offenses, \\nin 1992 (1991 arrest), 2000 (1997 arrest), and 2012 (2010 arrest). He was placed on \\nprobation in each instance.5 \\n \\n \\nIn  February  1991,  Applicant  was  driving  home  from  a  friend’s  house  where  he \\nconsumed  about  four  beers.  He  was  stopped  by  a  police  officer  who  had  observed \\nApplicant’s  car  cross  over  the  center  line.  Applicant  was  given,  and  failed,  a  field \\nsobriety test. He was taken into the police station where he refused a breathalyzer test. \\n                                                           \\n1 Item 2. \\n \\n2 Item 4. \\n \\n3 Items 1, 3. \\n \\n4 Item 10; AE A. \\n \\n5 Item 7, 9; AE A. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\\x0cHe was charged with OUI and later pleaded guilty. He was required to attend 12 weeks \\nof alcohol education and counseling classes, which he completed.6 \\n \\n \\nIn November 1997, Applicant was going home from a high school football game \\nwhen he was stopped in traffic by a police officer. Applicant had two beers before the \\ngame  and  shared  a  flask  containing  some  kind  of  alcohol  at  the  game.  The  officer \\napparently  asked  Applicant \\nif  he  had  been  drinking  and  Applicant  answered \\naffirmatively. He was then given field sobriety tests, which he failed. He was arrested, \\ntaken back to the police station and given a breathalyzer test, which he also failed. He \\nwas  found  guilty  of  OUI  and  sentenced  to  two  years’  probation,  loss  of  his  driver’s \\nlicense  for  six  months,  and  12  weeks  required  attendance  at  alcohol  education  and \\ncounseling classes.7 \\n \\n \\nIn  November  2010,  Applicant  was  driving  back  from  a  hockey  tournament  and \\nwas stopped by a state patrolman because he crossed the center line. Applicant had \\nconsumed six beers and shared a flask of whiskey at the hockey tournament. He failed \\nthe  field  sobriety  tests  and  was  almost  incoherent  to  the  patrolman.  He  was  arrested \\nand taken to a police station where he was offered a breathalyzer test. He was unable \\nto properly perform the test, which was deemed a refusal to take the test. He was found \\nguilty of OUI and sentenced to six months’ incarceration, five years of probation, loss of \\ndriver’s  license  for  five  years,  and  mandatory  substance  abuse  evaluation  and \\ntreatment.8 \\n \\nThe court-ordered substance abuse treatment involved two mandatory sessions \\n \\nand  Applicant  voluntarily  attended  six  more  sessions.  He \\nto  provide \\ndocumentation of any evaluation done by the counselors, but Applicant stated he was \\ndiagnosed  as  being  an  alcohol  abuser.  Applicant  also  attended  Alcohol  Anonymous \\n(AA) meetings once every six to eight weeks. He last attended an AA meeting in May \\n2015. He continued to drink an occasional beer every few months. In May 2015, at an \\nAA meeting he heard a story had made him decide to stop drinking alcohol entirely. He \\nclaims he has not had any alcohol since that time.9 \\n \\n\\nfailed \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n                                                           \\n6 Item 10. \\n \\n7 Item 10. \\n \\n8 Items 7, 10. \\n \\n9 Item 6-10; AE A. \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\\x0cThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\nfactors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ \\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \\nthe  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, \\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \\nmaking a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel,  and  has  the \\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  that  an  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. \\n\\n \\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of \\nthe national interest and shall  in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \\n\\nAG ¶ 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \\n\\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\\x0cAG  ¶  22  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security  concern  and  may  be \\n\\ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \\n\\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \\nthe  influence,  fighting,  child  or  spouse  abuse,  disturbing  the  peace,  or \\nother  incidents  of  concern,  regardless  of  whether  the  individual  is \\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;  \\n\\n(c)  habitual  or  binge  consumption  of  alcohol  to  the  point  of  impaired \\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \\nabuser or alcohol dependent. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nof both disqualifying conditions.  \\n\\nApplicant’s three OUI convictions and his drinking history support the application \\n\\nI  have  also  considered  all  of  the  mitigating  conditions  for  alcohol  consumption \\n\\nunder AG ¶ 23 and found the following relevant: \\n\\n(a)  so  much  time  has  passed,  or  the  behavior  was  so  infrequent,  or  it \\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \\nor good judgment; and \\n\\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \\nhas  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence  (if  alcohol  dependent)  or \\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser). \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  last  adverse  alcohol  incident  occurred  in  November  2010  and  he \\ncame  off  probation  for  that  offense  in  May  2015.  His  three  OUI  convictions  are  not \\ninfrequent  under  these  circumstances.  Insufficient  attenuation  exists  to  conclude \\nenough  time  has  passed  since  his  last  alcohol-related  incident.  His  history  of  OUI \\narrests  and  convictions  under  similar  circumstances  suggest  that  recurrence  is  a \\npossibility. His current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment are in doubt. AG ¶ \\n23(a) does not apply. \\n \\nApplicant recently decided to totally abstain from using alcohol. He indicated that \\n \\nhe has abstained since May 2015. While this is a commendable start, it is too soon to \\ndetermine whether his abstinence will continue to be part of his life or whether he will \\nuse alcohol responsibly in the future. AG ¶ 23(b) partially applies.   \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\\x0cconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\n(1) \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the circumstances that \\nled  to  his  arrests  and  his  current  state  of  abstinence.  Overall,  the  record  evidence \\nleaves  me  with  questions  and  doubts  as  to  Applicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I  conclude  Applicant  failed  to  mitigate  the \\nsecurity concerns under Guideline G. \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security \\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n                                               \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n_____________________________ \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n6 \\n \\n \\n\\nRobert E.
